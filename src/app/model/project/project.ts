      "For my senior capstone project at Cal Poly, I developed the Reality Market. The goal of this app was to create a unique marketplace while learning and applying good software devleopment practices along the way. The Reality Market allows users to transform everyday items into detailed 3D models, which can then be listed on the marketplace. Sellers can manage their listings by editing, deleting, or organizing them into categories. The app also allows users to save their favorite listings for later viewing. The main shopping feed consists of robust search functionality, sorting options, and filters to help users discover exactly what theyâ€™re looking for efficiently.",

This was made possbile by utalizing the object capture sample project provided made by apple. This flow returns a 3D Model in USDZ format, which then gets sent to storage. In order to scan an item, users will need to have a phone with LiDAR hardware. This is found only on pro models of the iPhone. Shoppers are also to view items in AR, in their own space. This is made possible by using apples quick look preivew view.",
